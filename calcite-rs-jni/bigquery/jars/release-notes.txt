Simba Google BigQuery JDBC Data Connector Release Notes 
============================================================================== 

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, known issues, and 
workflow changes in Simba Google BigQuery JDBC Connector 1.6.1, as well as the
version history. 


1.6.1 ========================================================================

Released 2024-07-23

Enhancements & New Features

 * [GBQJ-681] Primary key support

   The connector can now retrieve the list of primary keys using 
   getPrimaryKeys() metadata function.

 * [GBQJ-682] Bulk Insert using Storage Write API support

   The connector now can use storage write API property for Bulk insert. To do 
   this, set the EnableWriteAPI property to 1 for executeBatch. For more 
   information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.  
 
 * [GBQJ-683] Foreign key support

   The connector can now retrieve the list of foreign keys using 
   getImportedKey(), getExportedKeys(), and getCrossReference() metadata 
   functions. For more information about this feature, see: 
   - getImportedKey()
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#getImportedKeys-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-
   - getExportedKeys()
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#getExportedKeys-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-
   - getCrossReference()
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#getCrossReference-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-

 * [GBQJ-731] IAM roles support

   The connector now supports the following IAM roles for principle account to
   authenticate the connection:
   - BigQuery Data Editor
   - BigQuery Job User
   - BigQuery Read Session User

   The principle should have Storage Object Viewer or Storage Object User 
   responsibilities if queries are accessing cloud storage resources. Some 
   queries may require enhanced rights or roles and alter the access policies
   on various things.

   Note: Other options that customers may find useful in place of BigQuery 
   Data Editor are BigQuery Data Viewer and BigQuery Metadata Viewer. BigQuery
   Data Editor has bigquery.tables.updateData permission that is required for
   DML queries.

 * [GBQJ-735] Interval data type support

   The connector now supports the Internal data type that has been added to 
   storage Read API. For more information, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.  

 * [GBQJ-754] Low Latency support

   The connector can now execute a query without creating a job to improve the 
   performance. To do this, set the JobCreationMode property to 2. For more 
   information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.  


Resolved Issues
The following issue has been resolved in Simba Google BigQuery JDBC Connector 
1.6.1.

 * [GBQJ-745] The connector does not honor the maxResult value in 
   Tables.list API call.


Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in
the data source, the connector, or an application.

 * [GBQJ-594] The connector does not support executable-sourced credentials 
   for workforce and workload Identity Federation (External Account 
   Authentication).

 * The connector does not support parameterized types for Resultset and 
   Parameter metadata. 

   This is a limitation of the Google BigQuery server. 

 * Connector terminates when multiple connections are set to LogLevel=6.
  
   When multiple connections with the same LogPath directory are running with
   LogLevel set to 6, a collision might happen. This results in one of the 
   connections terminating unexpectedly. 

 * The connector no longer supports parameters in the exception block.
   
   This is a limitation of the Google BigQuery server discovered on Mar 2021.

 * TRACE level logs incorrectly contain stack trace for function entrances.

   When logging at the TRACE level (LogLevel=6), function entrance logs are 
   generated for each function that is called. These logs incorrectly 
   include a stack trace.

 * Query prefixes are not supported.

   The driver does not support query prefixes. To specify whether your query
   statements are to be processed using standard SQL or legacy BigQuery SQL, 
   configure the QueryDialect connection property. 

   By default, QueryDialect is set to "SQL" so that the driver uses standard
   SQL syntax. To use BigQuery SQL instead, set the property to "BIG_QUERY".

 * Support for ODBC Escape Sequences is limited.

   The only supported ODBC Escape Sequences are Scalar Functions of the form 
   {fn func(args)} if func is supported by the Google BigQuery data source 
   engine. 

 * When casting data, you must specify the data type according to Google 
   BigQuery standards.

   When casting data to a specific data type, you must use the corresponding 
   data type name shown in the "Casting" section of the Query Reference:
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/functions-and-operators#casting. 

   For example, to cast the "salary" column to the INTEGER type, you must 
   specify INT64 instead of INTEGER: 

      SELECT position, CAST(salary AS INT64) from Employee


Workflow Changes =============================================================

The following changes may disrupt established workflows for the connector.


1.5.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * [GBQJ-620] Updated OAuthClientId and OAuthClientSecret properties 

   The default values of the OAuthClientId is now Branded default Client ID 
   and OAuthClientSecret is now ***. Previously, the default values 
   were none and Simba client secret. For more information, see the 
   Installation and Configuration Guide.


1.3.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * [GBQJ-597] Updated Timeout property 

   The default value of the Timeout property is now 300. Previously, it was

   execution time in many scenarios. For more information, see the 
   Installation and Configuration Guide.


1.2.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Removed support for JDBC 4.1 (Java 7)

   Beginning with this release, the driver no longer supports JDBC 4.1 (Java
